Lab 8 Log:

First I ran the command:

sort --version

in order to make sure that I was using a new enough version of sort.
Next, I generated a file containing 10,000,000 random double-precision
floating point numbers by typing:

cat /dev/urandom | od -tf -N 10000000 > output.txt

In order to fomat my file correctly, I typed the following command:

cat output.txt | sed 's/^........//' | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//' | tr ' ' '\n' |
sed '/^$/d' > output2.txt

This command does the following:

deletes first eight characters because they are associated with the memory address
removes all whitespace to the left of the first number on each line
changes all spaces to newlines
deletes any blank lines

When running with 1, 2, 4, and 8 threads I obtained the following times:

[olaughli@lnxsrv07 ~]$ time -p sort -g output2.txt > /dev/null
real 3.93
user 20.92
sys 0.07

[olaughli@lnxsrv07 ~]$ time -p sort -g --parallel=2 output2.txt > /dev/null
real 10.05
user 19.11

[olaughli@lnxsrv07 ~]$ time -p sort -g --parallel=4 output2.txt > /dev/null

[olaughli@lnxsrv07 ~]$ time -p sort -g --parallel=8 output2.txt > /dev/null
