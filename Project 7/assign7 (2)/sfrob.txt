results of sfrob performance comparison:
In order to make a random file with 10000000 bytes I did  the following:

head --bytes=10000000 /dev/urandom > output.txt
this was on piazza

I used this file for the purpose of testing sfrob sfrobu and sfrobs
The commands were as follows:

time cat output.txt | ./sfrob | od -ta
time cat output.txt | ./sfrobs | od -ta
time cat output.txt | ./sfrobu | od -ta

The respective results were as follows:


real	0m25.332s
user	0m2.912s
sys	0m5.835s

real	0m21.493s
user	0m4.244s
sys	0m2.004s

real	0m27.812s
user	0m3.896s
sys	0m5.842s


The number of comparison were as follows:
20  	      47
700	      1887
1200          3578
8000          30933
10000	      37999

qsort runs at order nlog(n) so therefore this makes sense for the most part
