Lab 7 Log:

I first wrote two C transliteration programs called tr2b and tr2u. tr2b
used getchar and putchar into order to transliterate bytes while tr2u.c used
read and write to transliterate bytes. I had to implement checks to make sure
that there was no duplicates in the first argument for tr because you cannot
map one specific character to different characters. However, I did allow for
duplicates in the second argument of tr because different characters
should be able to be mapped to the same character. tr2u.c was the same as
tr2b.c except that I replaced the instances of getchar and putchar with
read and write respectively.


In order to compare the system calls issued by tr2b and tr2u commands
I created a file that contained 5 million 1s 
First I made a program that contained 5 million bytes. I did this using a loop
and using putchar.

I put these 5 million bytes into a file called anyfile:
./b > anyfile

strace gave me a list of the instructions that the computer ran. output.txt
contained the list of what instructions were ran:
cat anyfile | strace -o output.txt ./tr2b 1 2
cat anyfile | strace -o output.txt ./tr2u 1 2

Next, i did the same thing but copied one file to another:
cat anyfile | strace -o output.txt ./tr2b 1 2 > testfile
cat anyfile | strace -o output.txt ./tr2u 1 2 > testfile

Next, I compared the number of instructions needed in each case by
typing the following:

wc -l output.txt

I obtained the following results:

tr2b with output to terminal:6135
tr2b with output to file:10000028
tr2u with output to terminal:1329
tr2u with output to file:10000028

Next I used the time command to measure how much faster one program is when
compared to the other, when copying the same amount of data. I replaced
strace -o in the above commands with time -p and obtained the following
results:

cat anyfile | time -p ./tr2b 1 2:
2real 2.24
user 0.22
sys 0.05

cat anyfile | time -p ./tr2u 1 2:
2real 8.76
user 0.26
sys 7.70

cat anyfile | time -p ./tr2b 1 2 > testfile:
real 0.20
user 0.11
sys 0.00

cat anyfile | time -p ./tr2u 1 2 > testfile:
real 5.48
user 0.28
sys 5.11
