Homework 3 Answer:
Q1). Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style:"
because in the original code, there is a for loop with a "goto"
but this is removed in the patch so it would be confusing to 
leave the line in the code. However it does not have to be 
removed. 

Q2). Because the patched version of coreutils-7.6 changed the date 
display to the traditional unix format, things to watch out for would 
things that were relient on the date being displayed in the previous
format. In countries where users don't speak english and don't
understand English-format dates, new problems would be introduced
because the user might not recognize the month spellings, however,
the day and the year would most likely be recognizable. However, it
seems that the parameter LC_TIME could help set the language, but
that defeats the purpose of standardization. 

Q3). In order to invoke this script on an empty file like /dev/null, i typed
the following:

/usr/local/cs/bin/python randline.py -n 3 /dev/null

The resulting output was as follows:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
      main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
      sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
      return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.9/lib/python2.7/random.py",
  line 275, in choice
      return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
      # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Because /dev/null is an empty file it contains 0 lines, the script cannot
index its contents, thus the index error is generated:

IndexError: list index out of range

Simply put, you cannot possibly find a random line in a file that
does not contain any lines.

Q4).In order to invoke th script with Python 3 I typed the following:

/usr/local/cs/bin/python3 randline.py -n 3 file

It produced the following output:

  File "randline.py", line 65
      except IOError as (errno, strerror):

SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Thus, we see that Python 3 has a different syntax than Python 2 so
an "invalid syntax" exception is thrown because randline.py file
cannot be interpreted correctly.
