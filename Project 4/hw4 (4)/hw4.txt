Homework 4:
after creating a new verion of diffutils, I used "checkout in order to
change to v3.0.I then ran the patch command in this new branch with my patch
quote-3.0-patch.txt. I typed the following:

patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

I then emacsed into one of the patched files and typed C-x 4 a in order
to compose an appropriate change log entry for my patch. I only did this
in one of the six files cause it would have been repetitive to copy and
paste the same description for each file since you can see the description
anyway when you C-x 4 a in each file. From the spec I couldn't tell if
we were supposed to just write for one of the files or for all six so this
is what I did.

I committed my changes to a new branch by typing:

git add .
git commit -m "ChangeLog"

I recieved the following output:

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

I then proceeded to format my patch by using the "git format patch" command.
I typed the following:

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

Next I switched to another new branch of v3.0 and checked my patch by typing:

git am < formatted.patch.txt

After using 'make check' i found that the patch did work without having to
fix things by hand afterwords. I verified that my ChangeLog entry worked
by running the command "make distdir" and inspecting the resulting file.
I proceeded to test my partners patch as well while he tested mine. The
results verified that his patch worked as well as mine.
